'I code and manage people smarter than me'

A seasoned technology executive with experience in team building, innovation, back end and front end development. I love coding and this is an influence on the team.

At the beginning of my career, I worked on DB performance optimization, then startups
and networks. Some highlights over the years include working at NASA, mastering
SQL performance under load, publishing an early book on Java, before switching to front end
and web development. I also won trainer of the year by JDJ. The experience I have
