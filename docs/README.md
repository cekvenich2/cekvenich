'I code and manage people smarter than me'. <br />

Seasoned technology leader with experience in remote development, team building, innovation, back end and full-stack development. I love coding and this is an influence on the team.

At the beginning of my career, I worked on DB performance optimization, then startups
and networks. Some highlights over the years include working at NASA, mastering
SQL performance under load, publishing an early book on Java. I also won trainer of the year by JDJ. The experience I have
helps with perspective. I am proud to be a scalability/web expert. 
I have experience in managing an offshore team of up to 120 members, organizing and conducting meetings for project requirements and status discussions.

On a personal note: I did a few triathlons and I contribute and maintain open-source projects.
